In this stage, we have introduced three concepts: Otherness, Alteration, and Limit. The central turning point that allows us to transition to the next dialectical triad is the 'Transcendence-of-Limit'. This concept represents the overcoming of the limitations of a Something, leading to a new state of being or understanding, much like the positive outcome of two negatives. This allows us to progress from 'Limit' to a new stage in the dialectical process.
