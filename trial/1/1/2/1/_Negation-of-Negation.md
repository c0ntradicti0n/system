In this stage, we have introduced three concepts: Determinate Being, Negation, and Something. The central turning point that allows us to transition to the next dialectical triad is the 'Negation-of-Negation'. This concept is similar to 'minus * minus = plus', where the negation of the negation returns to an affirmation, allowing us to progress from 'Something' to a new stage in the dialectical process.
