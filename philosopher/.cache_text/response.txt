# 1 Metaphysics

Metaphysics, as a branch of philosophy, probes into the nature of existence, reality, and the cosmos, endeavoring to unveil the fundamental structures and principles that undergird the phenomenal world. This investigation examines dimensions beyond empirical observation and seeks to discern the foundational aspects of existence, including the nature of reality, the self, and the universe, and the interrelationships therein.
# 2 Anthropology

Anthropology, the study of human beings, societies, and cultures, investigates humanity's biological, social, and cultural dimensions. While metaphysics explores abstract principles and the fundamental nature of existence, anthropology focuses on humans and their societies, seeking to understand human life and behavior within various cultural contexts. This exploration creates a potential antithesis to metaphysics, grounding the lofty considerations of the metaphysical in the particularities of human culture and existence.
# 3 World

The world serves as a synthesis of metaphysics and anthropology, as it encapsulates both the metaphysical principles and the manifestations of human existence. The world, as a dialectical unity of metaphysics and anthropology, comprises both the underlying universal principles and the diverse realities of human societies and cultures. It incorporates both the transcendent elements of metaphysics and the immanent realities of human life, melding them into a single, holistic entity.
# _ System-Structure

The system-structure signifies the complex interplay of parts within a larger unity. In the context of our dialectical investigation, it emphasizes the dynamic relationships between metaphysics, anthropology, and the world. The system-structure acts as the dialectical antonym, the pivot around which the conversation evolves. By identifying the tensions and synergies between the philosophical exploration of existence and the empirical study of human life, it facilitates the development of a more comprehensive understanding of reality. This system-structure allows us to apprehend the unity in the diverse phenomena of existence, forming a coherent worldview that encompasses both the abstract and the concrete, the universal and the particular.
