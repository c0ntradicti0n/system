# 11 A Priori

A priori, a term derived from Latin, refers to knowledge that comes from the use of reason alone, independent of sensory experience or empirical evidence. It encompasses the principles, such as mathematical truths, logical axioms, or philosophical postulates, that are universally accepted due to their innate nature of being logically undeniable. A priori, as the thesis, emphasizes the role of innate understanding and logical necessity in constituting knowledge.
# 12 A Posteri

A posteriori, in contrast to a priori, is knowledge gained through sensory experience and empirical evidence. This antithesis acknowledges the contingent nature of much of our understanding, which relies on experiential observation and empirical validation. The a posteriori approach lays stress on the empirical validity of knowledge, emphasizing the role of experience and observation in knowledge formation.
# 13 Necessity

Necessity is the synthesis of the a priori and a posteriori. It recognizes the integral role of both innate reasoning and empirical validation in forming a comprehensive understanding. Knowledge is not solely based on logical reasoning nor confined to sensory experience; instead, it is the necessary intertwining of both. Necessity underlines the importance of combining rational analysis with empirical confirmation to produce robust and reliable knowledge.
# 1_ Synthetic a Priori

The synthetic a priori, the Inversive Dialectical Antonym, is a concept that resolves the opposition between the a priori and a posteriori by proposing that certain kinds of knowledge are both logically necessary and derived from experience. The term "synthetic" points to the fact that such knowledge adds something new to our understanding, rather than merely elucidating what is already contained within the concept, as with analytic a priori judgments. The synthetic a priori highlights the necessary role of both innate understanding and empirical observation in the formation of comprehensive knowledge.
