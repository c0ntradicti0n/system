The synthesis of Beauty and Ugliness gives rise to the concept of the Sublime. Sublime experiences can stem from beauty or ugliness and evoke feelings of awe, reverence, or even fear. The Sublime transcends the simple dichotomy of beauty and ugliness, representing a profound aesthetic experience that can be both pleasurable and terrifying.
