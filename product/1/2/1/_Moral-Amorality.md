The concept of 'Moral-Amorality' encapsulates the paradox that morality can exist within amorality and vice versa. In other words, an action can be morally right within one's personal perspective (Conscience) but may be considered amoral in a broader societal context, or the opposite. This concept paves the way for the next stage of the dialectical process, allowing for further exploration of the complexities of ethical judgement.
