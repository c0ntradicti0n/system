1. . - .: . filename [arguments]
    Execute commands from a file in the current shell.
    
    Read and execute commands from FILENAME in the current shell.  The
    entries in $PATH are used to find the directory containing FILENAME.
    If any ARGUMENTS are supplied, they become the positional parameters
    when FILENAME is executed.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last command executed in FILENAME; fails if
    FILENAME cannot be read.
2. : - :: :
    Null command.
    
    No effect; the command does nothing.
    
    Exit Status:
    Always succeeds.
3. [ - [: [ arg... ]
    Evaluate conditional expression.
    
    This is a synonym for the "test" builtin, but the last argument must
    be a literal `]', to match the opening `['.
4. alias - alias: alias [-p] [name[=value] ... ]
    Define or display aliases.
    
    Without arguments, `alias' prints the list of aliases in the reusable
    form `alias NAME=VALUE' on standard output.
    
    Otherwise, an alias is defined for each NAME whose VALUE is given.
    A trailing space in VALUE causes the next word to be checked for
    alias substitution when the alias is expanded.
    
    Options:
      -p	print all defined aliases in a reusable format
    
    Exit Status:
    alias returns true unless a NAME is supplied for which no alias has been
    defined.
5. bg - bg: bg [job_spec ...]
    Move jobs to the background.
    
    Place the jobs identified by each JOB_SPEC in the background, as if they
    had been started with `&'.  If JOB_SPEC is not present, the shell's notion
    of the current job is used.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless job control is not enabled or an error occurs.
6. bind - bind: bind [-lpsvPSVX] [-m keymap] [-f filename] [-q name] [-u name] [-r keyseq] [-x keyseq:shell-command] [keyseq:readline-function or readline-command]
    Set Readline key bindings and variables.
    
    Bind a key sequence to a Readline function or a macro, or set a
    Readline variable.  The non-option argument syntax is equivalent to
    that found in ~/.inputrc, but must be passed as a single argument:
    e.g., bind '"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file'.
    
    Options:
      -m  keymap         Use KEYMAP as the keymap for the duration of this
                         command.  Acceptable keymap names are emacs,
                         emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move,
                         vi-command, and vi-insert.
      -l                 List names of functions.
      -P                 List function names and bindings.
      -p                 List functions and bindings in a form that can be
                         reused as input.
      -S                 List key sequences that invoke macros and their values
      -s                 List key sequences that invoke macros and their values
                         in a form that can be reused as input.
      -V                 List variable names and values
      -v                 List variable names and values in a form that can
                         be reused as input.
      -q  function-name  Query about which keys invoke the named function.
      -u  function-name  Unbind all keys which are bound to the named function.
      -r  keyseq         Remove the binding for KEYSEQ.
      -f  filename       Read key bindings from FILENAME.
      -x  keyseq:shell-command	Cause SHELL-COMMAND to be executed when
    				KEYSEQ is entered.
      -X                 List key sequences bound with -x and associated commands
                         in a form that can be reused as input.
    
    Exit Status:
    bind returns 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurs.
7. break - break: break [n]
    Exit for, while, or until loops.
    
    Exit a FOR, WHILE or UNTIL loop.  If N is specified, break N enclosing
    loops.
    
    Exit Status:
    The exit status is 0 unless N is not greater than or equal to 1.
8. builtin - builtin: builtin [shell-builtin [arg ...]]
    Execute shell builtins.
    
    Execute SHELL-BUILTIN with arguments ARGs without performing command
    lookup.  This is useful when you wish to reimplement a shell builtin
    as a shell function, but need to execute the builtin within the function.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the exit status of SHELL-BUILTIN, or false if SHELL-BUILTIN is
    not a shell builtin.
9. caller - caller: caller [expr]
    Return the context of the current subroutine call.
    
    Without EXPR, returns "$line $filename".  With EXPR, returns
    "$line $subroutine $filename"; this extra information can be used to
    provide a stack trace.
    
    The value of EXPR indicates how many call frames to go back before the
    current one; the top frame is frame 0.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 unless the shell is not executing a shell function or EXPR
    is invalid.
10. cd - cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable. If DIR is "-", it is converted to $OLDPWD.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.
    
    Options:
      -L	force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic
    		links in DIR after processing instances of `..'
      -P	use the physical directory structure without following
    		symbolic links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before
    		processing instances of `..'
      -e	if the -P option is supplied, and the current working
    		directory cannot be determined successfully, exit with
    		a non-zero status
      -@	on systems that support it, present a file with extended
    		attributes as a directory containing the file attributes
    
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.
11. command - command: command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
    Execute a simple command or display information about commands.
    
    Runs COMMAND with ARGS suppressing  shell function lookup, or display
    information about the specified COMMANDs.  Can be used to invoke commands
    on disk when a function with the same name exists.
    
    Options:
      -p    use a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of
            the standard utilities
      -v    print a description of COMMAND similar to the `type' builtin
      -V    print a more verbose description of each COMMAND
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns exit status of COMMAND, or failure if COMMAND is not found.
12. compgen - compgen: compgen [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o option] [-A action] [-G globpat] [-W wordlist] [-F function] [-C command] [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] [word]
    Display possible completions depending on the options.
    
    Intended to be used from within a shell function generating possible
    completions.  If the optional WORD argument is supplied, matches against
    WORD are generated.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.
13. complete - complete: complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-pr] [-DEI] [-o option] [-A action] [-G globpat] [-W wordlist] [-F function] [-C command] [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] [name ...]
    Specify how arguments are to be completed by Readline.
    
    For each NAME, specify how arguments are to be completed.  If no options
    are supplied, existing completion specifications are printed in a way that
    allows them to be reused as input.
    
    Options:
      -p	print existing completion specifications in a reusable format
      -r	remove a completion specification for each NAME, or, if no
    		NAMEs are supplied, all completion specifications
      -D	apply the completions and actions as the default for commands
    		without any specific completion defined
      -E	apply the completions and actions to "empty" commands --
    		completion attempted on a blank line
      -I	apply the completions and actions to the initial (usually the
    		command) word
    
    When completion is attempted, the actions are applied in the order the
    uppercase-letter options are listed above. If multiple options are supplied,
    the -D option takes precedence over -E, and both take precedence over -I.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.
14. compopt - compopt: compopt [-o|+o option] [-DEI] [name ...]
    Modify or display completion options.
    
    Modify the completion options for each NAME, or, if no NAMEs are supplied,
    the completion currently being executed.  If no OPTIONs are given, print
    the completion options for each NAME or the current completion specification.
    
    Options:
    	-o option	Set completion option OPTION for each NAME
    	-D		Change options for the "default" command completion
    	-E		Change options for the "empty" command completion
    	-I		Change options for completion on the initial word
    
    Using `+o' instead of `-o' turns off the specified option.
    
    Arguments:
    
    Each NAME refers to a command for which a completion specification must
    have previously been defined using the `complete' builtin.  If no NAMEs
    are supplied, compopt must be called by a function currently generating
    completions, and the options for that currently-executing completion
    generator are modified.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or NAME does not
    have a completion specification defined.
15. continue - continue: continue [n]
    Resume for, while, or until loops.
    
    Resumes the next iteration of the enclosing FOR, WHILE or UNTIL loop.
    If N is specified, resumes the Nth enclosing loop.
    
    Exit Status:
    The exit status is 0 unless N is not greater than or equal to 1.
16. declare - declare: declare [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [name[=value] ...] or declare -p [-aAfFilnrtux] [name ...]
    Set variable values and attributes.
    
    Declare variables and give them attributes.  If no NAMEs are given,
    display the attributes and values of all variables.
    
    Options:
      -f	restrict action or display to function names and definitions
      -F	restrict display to function names only (plus line number and
    		source file when debugging)
      -g	create global variables when used in a shell function; otherwise
    		ignored
      -I	if creating a local variable, inherit the attributes and value
    		of a variable with the same name at a previous scope
      -p	display the attributes and value of each NAME
    
    Options which set attributes:
      -a	to make NAMEs indexed arrays (if supported)
      -A	to make NAMEs associative arrays (if supported)
      -i	to make NAMEs have the `integer' attribute
      -l	to convert the value of each NAME to lower case on assignment
      -n	make NAME a reference to the variable named by its value
      -r	to make NAMEs readonly
      -t	to make NAMEs have the `trace' attribute
      -u	to convert the value of each NAME to upper case on assignment
      -x	to make NAMEs export
    
    Using `+' instead of `-' turns off the given attribute.
    
    Variables with the integer attribute have arithmetic evaluation (see
    the `let' command) performed when the variable is assigned a value.
    
    When used in a function, `declare' makes NAMEs local, as with the `local'
    command.  The `-g' option suppresses this behavior.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or a variable
    assignment error occurs.
17. dirs - dirs: dirs [-clpv] [+N] [-N]
    Display directory stack.
    
    Display the list of currently remembered directories.  Directories
    find their way onto the list with the `pushd' command; you can get
    back up through the list with the `popd' command.
    
    Options:
      -c	clear the directory stack by deleting all of the elements
      -l	do not print tilde-prefixed versions of directories relative
    		to your home directory
      -p	print the directory stack with one entry per line
      -v	print the directory stack with one entry per line prefixed
    		with its position in the stack
    
    Arguments:
      +N	Displays the Nth entry counting from the left of the list
    		shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting with
    		zero.
    
      -N	Displays the Nth entry counting from the right of the list
    		shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting with
    		zero.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.
18. disown - disown: disown [-h] [-ar] [jobspec ... | pid ...]
    Remove jobs from current shell.
    
    Removes each JOBSPEC argument from the table of active jobs.  Without
    any JOBSPECs, the shell uses its notion of the current job.
    
    Options:
      -a	remove all jobs if JOBSPEC is not supplied
      -h	mark each JOBSPEC so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the
    		shell receives a SIGHUP
      -r	remove only running jobs
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option or JOBSPEC is given.
19. echo - echo: echo [-neE] [arg ...]
    Write arguments to the standard output.
    
    Display the ARGs, separated by a single space character and followed by a
    newline, on the standard output.
    
    Options:
      -n	do not append a newline
      -e	enable interpretation of the following backslash escapes
      -E	explicitly suppress interpretation of backslash escapes
    
    `echo' interprets the following backslash-escaped characters:
      \a	alert (bell)
      \b	backspace
      \c	suppress further output
      \e	escape character
      \E	escape character
      \f	form feed
      \n	new line
      \r	carriage return
      \t	horizontal tab
      \v	vertical tab
      \\	backslash
      \0nnn	the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).  NNN can be
    		0 to 3 octal digits
      \xHH	the eight-bit character whose value is HH (hexadecimal).  HH
    		can be one or two hex digits
      \uHHHH	the Unicode character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH.
    		HHHH can be one to four hex digits.
      \UHHHHHHHH the Unicode character whose value is the hexadecimal value
    		HHHHHHHH. HHHHHHHH can be one to eight hex digits.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless a write error occurs.
20. enable - enable: enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f filename] [name ...]
    Enable and disable shell builtins.
    
    Enables and disables builtin shell commands.  Disabling allows you to
    execute a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin
    without using a full pathname.
    
    Options:
      -a	print a list of builtins showing whether or not each is enabled
      -n	disable each NAME or display a list of disabled builtins
      -p	print the list of builtins in a reusable format
      -s	print only the names of Posix `special' builtins
    
    Options controlling dynamic loading:
      -f	Load builtin NAME from shared object FILENAME
      -d	Remove a builtin loaded with -f
    
    Without options, each NAME is enabled.
    
    To use the `test' found in $PATH instead of the shell builtin
    version, type `enable -n test'.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless NAME is not a shell builtin or an error occurs.
21. eval - eval: eval [arg ...]
    Execute arguments as a shell command.
    
    Combine ARGs into a single string, use the result as input to the shell,
    and execute the resulting commands.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns exit status of command or success if command is null.
22. exec - exec: exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [argument ...]] [redirection ...]
    Replace the shell with the given command.
    
    Execute COMMAND, replacing this shell with the specified program.
    ARGUMENTS become the arguments to COMMAND.  If COMMAND is not specified,
    any redirections take effect in the current shell.
    
    Options:
      -a name	pass NAME as the zeroth argument to COMMAND
      -c	execute COMMAND with an empty environment
      -l	place a dash in the zeroth argument to COMMAND
    
    If the command cannot be executed, a non-interactive shell exits, unless
    the shell option `execfail' is set.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless COMMAND is not found or a redirection error occurs.
23. exit - exit: exit [n]
    Exit the shell.
    
    Exits the shell with a status of N.  If N is omitted, the exit status
    is that of the last command executed.
24. export - export: export [-fn] [name[=value] ...] or export -p
    Set export attribute for shell variables.
    
    Marks each NAME for automatic export to the environment of subsequently
    executed commands.  If VALUE is supplied, assign VALUE before exporting.
    
    Options:
      -f	refer to shell functions
      -n	remove the export property from each NAME
      -p	display a list of all exported variables and functions
    
    An argument of `--' disables further option processing.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or NAME is invalid.
25. false - false: false
    Return an unsuccessful result.
    
    Exit Status:
    Always fails.
26. fc - fc: fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last] or fc -s [pat=rep] [command]
    Display or execute commands from the history list.
    
    fc is used to list or edit and re-execute commands from the history list.
    FIRST and LAST can be numbers specifying the range, or FIRST can be a
    string, which means the most recent command beginning with that
    string.
    
    Options:
      -e ENAME	select which editor to use.  Default is FCEDIT, then EDITOR,
    		then vi
      -l 	list lines instead of editing
      -n	omit line numbers when listing
      -r	reverse the order of the lines (newest listed first)
    
    With the `fc -s [pat=rep ...] [command]' format, COMMAND is
    re-executed after the substitution OLD=NEW is performed.
    
    A useful alias to use with this is r='fc -s', so that typing `r cc'
    runs the last command beginning with `cc' and typing `r' re-executes
    the last command.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success or status of executed command; non-zero if an error occurs.
27. fg - fg: fg [job_spec]
    Move job to the foreground.
    
    Place the job identified by JOB_SPEC in the foreground, making it the
    current job.  If JOB_SPEC is not present, the shell's notion of the
    current job is used.
    
    Exit Status:
    Status of command placed in foreground, or failure if an error occurs.
28. getopts - getopts: getopts optstring name [arg ...]
    Parse option arguments.
    
    Getopts is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters
    as options.
    
    OPTSTRING contains the option letters to be recognized; if a letter
    is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument,
    which should be separated from it by white space.
    
    Each time it is invoked, getopts will place the next option in the
    shell variable $name, initializing name if it does not exist, and
    the index of the next argument to be processed into the shell
    variable OPTIND.  OPTIND is initialized to 1 each time the shell or
    a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an argument,
    getopts places that argument into the shell variable OPTARG.
    
    getopts reports errors in one of two ways.  If the first character
    of OPTSTRING is a colon, getopts uses silent error reporting.  In
    this mode, no error messages are printed.  If an invalid option is
    seen, getopts places the option character found into OPTARG.  If a
    required argument is not found, getopts places a ':' into NAME and
    sets OPTARG to the option character found.  If getopts is not in
    silent mode, and an invalid option is seen, getopts places '?' into
    NAME and unsets OPTARG.  If a required argument is not found, a '?'
    is placed in NAME, OPTARG is unset, and a diagnostic message is
    printed.
    
    If the shell variable OPTERR has the value 0, getopts disables the
    printing of error messages, even if the first character of
    OPTSTRING is not a colon.  OPTERR has the value 1 by default.
    
    Getopts normally parses the positional parameters, but if arguments
    are supplied as ARG values, they are parsed instead.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success if an option is found; fails if the end of options is
    encountered or an error occurs.
29. hash - hash: hash [-lr] [-p pathname] [-dt] [name ...]
    Remember or display program locations.
    
    Determine and remember the full pathname of each command NAME.  If
    no arguments are given, information about remembered commands is displayed.
    
    Options:
      -d	forget the remembered location of each NAME
      -l	display in a format that may be reused as input
      -p pathname	use PATHNAME as the full pathname of NAME
      -r	forget all remembered locations
      -t	print the remembered location of each NAME, preceding
    		each location with the corresponding NAME if multiple
    		NAMEs are given
    Arguments:
      NAME	Each NAME is searched for in $PATH and added to the list
    		of remembered commands.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless NAME is not found or an invalid option is given.
30. help - help: help [-dms] [pattern ...]
    Display information about builtin commands.
    
    Displays brief summaries of builtin commands.  If PATTERN is
    specified, gives detailed help on all commands matching PATTERN,
    otherwise the list of help topics is printed.
    
    Options:
      -d	output short description for each topic
      -m	display usage in pseudo-manpage format
      -s	output only a short usage synopsis for each topic matching
    		PATTERN
    
    Arguments:
      PATTERN	Pattern specifying a help topic
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless PATTERN is not found or an invalid option is given.
31. history - history: history [-c] [-d offset] [n] or history -anrw [filename] or history -ps arg [arg...]
    Display or manipulate the history list.
    
    Display the history list with line numbers, prefixing each modified
    entry with a `*'.  An argument of N lists only the last N entries.
    
    Options:
      -c	clear the history list by deleting all of the entries
      -d offset	delete the history entry at position OFFSET. Negative
    		offsets count back from the end of the history list
    
      -a	append history lines from this session to the history file
      -n	read all history lines not already read from the history file
    		and append them to the history list
      -r	read the history file and append the contents to the history
    		list
      -w	write the current history to the history file
    
      -p	perform history expansion on each ARG and display the result
    		without storing it in the history list
      -s	append the ARGs to the history list as a single entry
    
    If FILENAME is given, it is used as the history file.  Otherwise,
    if HISTFILE has a value, that is used, else ~/.bash_history.
    
    If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set and not null, its value is used
    as a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated
    with each displayed history entry.  No time stamps are printed otherwise.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or an error occurs.
32. jobs - jobs: jobs [-lnprs] [jobspec ...] or jobs -x command [args]
    Display status of jobs.
    
    Lists the active jobs.  JOBSPEC restricts output to that job.
    Without options, the status of all active jobs is displayed.
    
    Options:
      -l	lists process IDs in addition to the normal information
      -n	lists only processes that have changed status since the last
    		notification
      -p	lists process IDs only
      -r	restrict output to running jobs
      -s	restrict output to stopped jobs
    
    If -x is supplied, COMMAND is run after all job specifications that
    appear in ARGS have been replaced with the process ID of that job's
    process group leader.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or an error occurs.
    If -x is used, returns the exit status of COMMAND.
33. kill - kill: kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] pid | jobspec ... or kill -l [sigspec]
    Send a signal to a job.
    
    Send the processes identified by PID or JOBSPEC the signal named by
    SIGSPEC or SIGNUM.  If neither SIGSPEC nor SIGNUM is present, then
    SIGTERM is assumed.
    
    Options:
      -s sig	SIG is a signal name
      -n sig	SIG is a signal number
      -l	list the signal names; if arguments follow `-l' they are
    		assumed to be signal numbers for which names should be listed
      -L	synonym for -l
    
    Kill is a shell builtin for two reasons: it allows job IDs to be used
    instead of process IDs, and allows processes to be killed if the limit
    on processes that you can create is reached.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or an error occurs.
34. let - let: let arg [arg ...]
    Evaluate arithmetic expressions.
    
    Evaluate each ARG as an arithmetic expression.  Evaluation is done in
    fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0
    is trapped and flagged as an error.  The following list of operators is
    grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed
    in order of decreasing precedence.
    
    	id++, id--	variable post-increment, post-decrement
    	++id, --id	variable pre-increment, pre-decrement
    	-, +		unary minus, plus
    	!, ~		logical and bitwise negation
    	**		exponentiation
    	*, /, %		multiplication, division, remainder
    	+, -		addition, subtraction
    	<<, >>		left and right bitwise shifts
    	<=, >=, <, >	comparison
    	==, !=		equality, inequality
    	&		bitwise AND
    	^		bitwise XOR
    	|		bitwise OR
    	&&		logical AND
    	||		logical OR
    	expr ? expr : expr
    			conditional operator
    	=, *=, /=, %=,
    	+=, -=, <<=, >>=,
    	&=, ^=, |=	assignment
    
    Shell variables are allowed as operands.  The name of the variable
    is replaced by its value (coerced to a fixed-width integer) within
    an expression.  The variable need not have its integer attribute
    turned on to be used in an expression.
    
    Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in
    parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence
    rules above.
    
    Exit Status:
    If the last ARG evaluates to 0, let returns 1; let returns 0 otherwise.
35. local - local: local [option] name[=value] ...
    Define local variables.
    
    Create a local variable called NAME, and give it VALUE.  OPTION can
    be any option accepted by `declare'.
    
    Local variables can only be used within a function; they are visible
    only to the function where they are defined and its children.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied, a variable
    assignment error occurs, or the shell is not executing a function.
36. logout - logout: logout [n]
    Exit a login shell.
    
    Exits a login shell with exit status N.  Returns an error if not executed
    in a login shell.
37. mapfile - mapfile: mapfile [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
    Read lines from the standard input into an indexed array variable.
    
    Read lines from the standard input into the indexed array variable ARRAY, or
    from file descriptor FD if the -u option is supplied.  The variable MAPFILE
    is the default ARRAY.
    
    Options:
      -d delim	Use DELIM to terminate lines, instead of newline
      -n count	Copy at most COUNT lines.  If COUNT is 0, all lines are copied
      -O origin	Begin assigning to ARRAY at index ORIGIN.  The default index is 0
      -s count	Discard the first COUNT lines read
      -t	Remove a trailing DELIM from each line read (default newline)
      -u fd	Read lines from file descriptor FD instead of the standard input
      -C callback	Evaluate CALLBACK each time QUANTUM lines are read
      -c quantum	Specify the number of lines read between each call to
    			CALLBACK
    
    Arguments:
      ARRAY	Array variable name to use for file data
    
    If -C is supplied without -c, the default quantum is 5000.  When
    CALLBACK is evaluated, it is supplied the index of the next array
    element to be assigned and the line to be assigned to that element
    as additional arguments.
    
    If not supplied with an explicit origin, mapfile will clear ARRAY before
    assigning to it.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or ARRAY is readonly or
    not an indexed array.
38. popd - popd: popd [-n] [+N | -N]
    Remove directories from stack.
    
    Removes entries from the directory stack.  With no arguments, removes
    the top directory from the stack, and changes to the new top directory.
    
    Options:
      -n	Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing
    		directories from the stack, so only the stack is manipulated.
    
    Arguments:
      +N	Removes the Nth entry counting from the left of the list
    		shown by `dirs', starting with zero.  For example: `popd +0'
    		removes the first directory, `popd +1' the second.
    
      -N	Removes the Nth entry counting from the right of the list
    		shown by `dirs', starting with zero.  For example: `popd -0'
    		removes the last directory, `popd -1' the next to last.
    
    The `dirs' builtin displays the directory stack.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid argument is supplied or the directory
    change fails.
39. printf - printf: printf [-v var] format [arguments]
    Formats and prints ARGUMENTS under control of the FORMAT.
    
    Options:
      -v var	assign the output to shell variable VAR rather than
    		display it on the standard output
    
    FORMAT is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain
    characters, which are simply copied to standard output; character escape
    sequences, which are converted and copied to the standard output; and
    format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive
    argument.
    
    In addition to the standard format specifications described in printf(1),
    printf interprets:
    
      %b	expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding argument
      %q	quote the argument in a way that can be reused as shell input
      %Q	like %q, but apply any precision to the unquoted argument before
    		quoting
      %(fmt)T	output the date-time string resulting from using FMT as a format
    	        string for strftime(3)
    
    The format is re-used as necessary to consume all of the arguments.  If
    there are fewer arguments than the format requires,  extra format
    specifications behave as if a zero value or null string, as appropriate,
    had been supplied.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or a write or assignment
    error occurs.
40. pushd - pushd: pushd [-n] [+N | -N | dir]
    Add directories to stack.
    
    Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates
    the stack, making the new top of the stack the current working
    directory.  With no arguments, exchanges the top two directories.
    
    Options:
      -n	Suppresses the normal change of directory when adding
    		directories to the stack, so only the stack is manipulated.
    
    Arguments:
      +N	Rotates the stack so that the Nth directory (counting
    		from the left of the list shown by `dirs', starting with
    		zero) is at the top.
    
      -N	Rotates the stack so that the Nth directory (counting
    		from the right of the list shown by `dirs', starting with
    		zero) is at the top.
    
      dir	Adds DIR to the directory stack at the top, making it the
    		new current working directory.
    
    The `dirs' builtin displays the directory stack.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid argument is supplied or the directory
    change fails.
41. pwd - pwd: pwd [-LP]
    Print the name of the current working directory.
    
    Options:
      -L	print the value of $PWD if it names the current working
    		directory
      -P	print the physical directory, without any symbolic links
    
    By default, `pwd' behaves as if `-L' were specified.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 unless an invalid option is given or the current directory
    cannot be read.
42. read - read: read [-ers] [-a array] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]
    Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields.
    
    Reads a single line from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD
    if the -u option is supplied.  The line is split into fields as with word
    splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second
    word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to
    the last NAME.  Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word
    delimiters. By default, the backslash character escapes delimiter characters
    and newline.
    
    If no NAMEs are supplied, the line read is stored in the REPLY variable.
    
    Options:
      -a array	assign the words read to sequential indices of the array
    		variable ARRAY, starting at zero
      -d delim	continue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather
    		than newline
      -e	use Readline to obtain the line
      -i text	use TEXT as the initial text for Readline
      -n nchars	return after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting
    		for a newline, but honor a delimiter if fewer than
    		NCHARS characters are read before the delimiter
      -N nchars	return only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, unless
    		EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any
    		delimiter
      -p prompt	output the string PROMPT without a trailing newline before
    		attempting to read
      -r	do not allow backslashes to escape any characters
      -s	do not echo input coming from a terminal
      -t timeout	time out and return failure if a complete line of
    		input is not read within TIMEOUT seconds.  The value of the
    		TMOUT variable is the default timeout.  TIMEOUT may be a
    		fractional number.  If TIMEOUT is 0, read returns
    		immediately, without trying to read any data, returning
    		success only if input is available on the specified
    		file descriptor.  The exit status is greater than 128
    		if the timeout is exceeded
      -u fd	read from file descriptor FD instead of the standard input
    
    Exit Status:
    The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out
    (in which case it's greater than 128), a variable assignment error occurs,
    or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.
43. readarray - readarray: readarray [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
    Read lines from a file into an array variable.
    
    A synonym for `mapfile'.
44. readonly - readonly: readonly [-aAf] [name[=value] ...] or readonly -p
    Mark shell variables as unchangeable.
    
    Mark each NAME as read-only; the values of these NAMEs may not be
    changed by subsequent assignment.  If VALUE is supplied, assign VALUE
    before marking as read-only.
    
    Options:
      -a	refer to indexed array variables
      -A	refer to associative array variables
      -f	refer to shell functions
      -p	display a list of all readonly variables or functions,
    		depending on whether or not the -f option is given
    
    An argument of `--' disables further option processing.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or NAME is invalid.
45. return - return: return [n]
    Return from a shell function.
    
    Causes a function or sourced script to exit with the return value
    specified by N.  If N is omitted, the return status is that of the
    last command executed within the function or script.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns N, or failure if the shell is not executing a function or script.
46. set - set: set [-abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [-o option-name] [--] [-] [arg ...]
    Set or unset values of shell options and positional parameters.
    
    Change the value of shell attributes and positional parameters, or
    display the names and values of shell variables.
    
    Options:
      -a  Mark variables which are modified or created for export.
      -b  Notify of job termination immediately.

              pipefail     the return value of a pipeline is the status of
                           the last command to exit with a non-zero status,
                           or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status
              posix        change the behavior of bash where the default
                           operation differs from the Posix standard to

      -p  Turned on whenever the real and effective user ids do not match.
          Disables processing of the $ENV file and importing of shell
          functions.  Turning this option off causes the effective uid and
          gid to be set to the real uid and gid.
      -t  Exit after reading and executing one command.
      -u  Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
      -v  Print shell input lines as they are read.

          such as cd which change the current directory.
      -T  If set, the DEBUG and RETURN traps are inherited by shell functions.
      --  Assign any remaining arguments to the positional parameters.
          If there are no remaining arguments, the positional parameters
          are unset.
      -   Assign any remaining arguments to the positional parameters.
          The -x and -v options are turned off.
    
    Using + rather than - causes these flags to be turned off.  The
    flags can also be used upon invocation of the shell.  The current
    set of flags may be found in $-.  The remaining n ARGs are positional
    parameters and are assigned, in order, to $1, $2, .. $n.  If no
    ARGs are given, all shell variables are printed.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given.
47. shift - shift: shift [n]
    Shift positional parameters.
    
    Rename the positional parameters $N+1,$N+2 ... to $1,$2 ...  If N is
    not given, it is assumed to be 1.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless N is negative or greater than $#.
48. shopt - shopt: shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]
    Set and unset shell options.
    
    Change the setting of each shell option OPTNAME.  Without any option
    arguments, list each supplied OPTNAME, or all shell options if no
    OPTNAMEs are given, with an indication of whether or not each is set.
    
    Options:
      -o	restrict OPTNAMEs to those defined for use with `set -o'
      -p	print each shell option with an indication of its status
      -q	suppress output
      -s	enable (set) each OPTNAME
      -u	disable (unset) each OPTNAME
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success if OPTNAME is enabled; fails if an invalid option is
    given or OPTNAME is disabled.
49. source - source: source filename [arguments]
    Execute commands from a file in the current shell.
    
    Read and execute commands from FILENAME in the current shell.  The
    entries in $PATH are used to find the directory containing FILENAME.
    If any ARGUMENTS are supplied, they become the positional parameters
    when FILENAME is executed.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last command executed in FILENAME; fails if
    FILENAME cannot be read.
50. suspend - suspend: suspend [-f]
    Suspend shell execution.
    
    Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT signal.
    Unless forced, login shells and shells without job control cannot be
    suspended.
    
    Options:
      -f	force the suspend, even if the shell is a login shell or job
    		control is not enabled.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless job control is not enabled or an error occurs.
51. test - test: test [expr]
    Evaluate conditional expression.
    
    Exits with a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on
    the evaluation of EXPR.  Expressions may be unary or binary.  Unary
    expressions are often used to examine the status of a file.  There
    are string operators and numeric comparison operators as well.
    
    The behavior of test depends on the number of arguments.  Read the
    bash manual page for the complete specification.
    
    File operators:
    
      -a FILE        True if file exists.
      -b FILE        True if file is block special.
      -c FILE        True if file is character special.

      -u FILE        True if the file is set-user-id.
      -w FILE        True if the file is writable by you.
      -x FILE        True if the file is executable by you.
      -O FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by you.
      -G FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by your group.
      -N FILE        True if the file has been modified since it was last read.
    
      FILE1 -nt FILE2  True if file1 is newer than file2 (according to
                       modification date).
    
      FILE1 -ot FILE2  True if file1 is older than file2.
    
      FILE1 -ef FILE2  True if file1 is a hard link to file2.
    
    All file operators except -h and -L are acting on the target of a symbolic
    link, not on the symlink itself, if FILE is a symbolic link.
    
    String operators:
    
      -z STRING      True if string is empty.
    
      -n STRING
         STRING      True if string is not empty.
    
      STRING1 = STRING2
                     True if the strings are equal.
      STRING1 != STRING2
                     True if the strings are not equal.
      STRING1 < STRING2
                     True if STRING1 sorts before STRING2 lexicographically.
      STRING1 > STRING2
                     True if STRING1 sorts after STRING2 lexicographically.
    
    Other operators:

      -v VAR         True if the shell variable VAR is set.
      -R VAR         True if the shell variable VAR is set and is a name
                     reference.
      ! EXPR         True if expr is false.
      EXPR1 -a EXPR2 True if both expr1 AND expr2 are true.
      EXPR1 -o EXPR2 True if either expr1 OR expr2 is true.
    
      arg1 OP arg2   Arithmetic tests.  OP is one of -eq, -ne,
                     -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.
    
    Arithmetic binary operators return true if ARG1 is equal, not-equal,
    less-than, less-than-or-equal, greater-than, or greater-than-or-equal
    than ARG2.
    
    See the bash manual page bash(1) for the handling of parameters (i.e.
    missing parameters).
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success if EXPR evaluates to true; fails if EXPR evaluates to
    false or an invalid argument is given.
52. times - times: times
    Display process times.
    
    Prints the accumulated user and system times for the shell and all of its
    child processes.
    
    Exit Status:
    Always succeeds.
53. trap - trap: trap [-lp] [[arg] signal_spec ...]
    Trap signals and other events.
    
    Defines and activates handlers to be run when the shell receives signals
    or other conditions.
    
    ARG is a command to be read and executed when the shell receives the
    signal(s) SIGNAL_SPEC.  If ARG is absent (and a single SIGNAL_SPEC
    is supplied) or `-', each specified signal is reset to its original
    value.  If ARG is the null string each SIGNAL_SPEC is ignored by the
    shell and by the commands it invokes.
    
    If a SIGNAL_SPEC is EXIT (0) ARG is executed on exit from the shell.  If
    a SIGNAL_SPEC is DEBUG, ARG is executed before every simple command.  If
    a SIGNAL_SPEC is RETURN, ARG is executed each time a shell function or a
    script run by the . or source builtins finishes executing.  A SIGNAL_SPEC
    of ERR means to execute ARG each time a command's failure would cause the
    shell to exit when the -e option is enabled.
    
    If no arguments are supplied, trap prints the list of commands associated
    with each signal.
    
    Options:
      -l	print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers
      -p	display the trap commands associated with each SIGNAL_SPEC
    
    Each SIGNAL_SPEC is either a signal name in <signal.h> or a signal number.
    Signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional.  A
    signal may be sent to the shell with "kill -signal $$".
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless a SIGSPEC is invalid or an invalid option is given.
54. true - true: true
    Return a successful result.
    
    Exit Status:
    Always succeeds.
55. type - type: type [-afptP] name [name ...]
    Display information about command type.
    
    For each NAME, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a
    command name.
    
    Options:
      -a	display all locations containing an executable named NAME;
    		includes aliases, builtins, and functions, if and only if
    		the `-p' option is not also used
      -f	suppress shell function lookup
      -P	force a PATH search for each NAME, even if it is an alias,
    		builtin, or function, and returns the name of the disk file
    		that would be executed
      -p	returns either the name of the disk file that would be executed,
    		or nothing if `type -t NAME' would not return `file'
      -t	output a single word which is one of `alias', `keyword',
    		`function', `builtin', `file' or `', if NAME is an alias,
    		shell reserved word, shell function, shell builtin, disk file,
    		or not found, respectively
    
    Arguments:
      NAME	Command name to be interpreted.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success if all of the NAMEs are found; fails if any are not found.
56. typeset - typeset: typeset [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] name[=value] ... or typeset -p [-aAfFilnrtux] [name ...]
    Set variable values and attributes.
    
    A synonym for `declare'.  See `help declare'.
57. ulimit - ulimit: ulimit [-SHabcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPRT] [limit]
    Modify shell resource limits.
    
    Provides control over the resources available to the shell and processes
    it creates, on systems that allow such control.
    
    Options:
      -S	use the `soft' resource limit
      -H	use the `hard' resource limit
      -a	all current limits are reported
      -b	the socket buffer size
      -c	the maximum size of core files created
      -d	the maximum size of a process's data segment
      -e	the maximum scheduling priority (`nice')
      -f	the maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
      -i	the maximum number of pending signals
      -k	the maximum number of kqueues allocated for this process
      -l	the maximum size a process may lock into memory
      -m	the maximum resident set size
      -n	the maximum number of open file descriptors
      -p	the pipe buffer size
      -q	the maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
      -r	the maximum real-time scheduling priority
      -s	the maximum stack size
      -t	the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
      -u	the maximum number of user processes
      -v	the size of virtual memory
      -x	the maximum number of file locks
      -P	the maximum number of pseudoterminals
      -R	the maximum time a real-time process can run before blocking
      -T	the maximum number of threads
    
    Not all options are available on all platforms.
    
    If LIMIT is given, it is the new value of the specified resource; the
    special LIMIT values `soft', `hard', and `unlimited' stand for the
    current soft limit, the current hard limit, and no limit, respectively.
    Otherwise, the current value of the specified resource is printed.  If
    no option is given, then -f is assumed.
    
    Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for -t, which is in seconds,
    -p, which is in increments of 512 bytes, and -u, which is an unscaled
    number of processes.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.
58. umask - umask: umask [-p] [-S] [mode]
    Display or set file mode mask.
    
    Sets the user file-creation mask to MODE.  If MODE is omitted, prints
    the current value of the mask.
    
    If MODE begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number;
    otherwise it is a symbolic mode string like that accepted by chmod(1).
    
    Options:
      -p	if MODE is omitted, output in a form that may be reused as input
      -S	makes the output symbolic; otherwise an octal number is output
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless MODE is invalid or an invalid option is given.
59. unalias - unalias: unalias [-a] name [name ...]
    Remove each NAME from the list of defined aliases.
    
    Options:
      -a	remove all alias definitions
    
    Return success unless a NAME is not an existing alias.
60. unset - unset: unset [-f] [-v] [-n] [name ...]
    Unset values and attributes of shell variables and functions.
    
    For each NAME, remove the corresponding variable or function.
    
    Options:
      -f	treat each NAME as a shell function
      -v	treat each NAME as a shell variable
      -n	treat each NAME as a name reference and unset the variable itself
    		rather than the variable it references
    
    Without options, unset first tries to unset a variable, and if that fails,
    tries to unset a function.
    
    Some variables cannot be unset; also see `readonly'.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or a NAME is read-only.
61. wait - wait: wait [-fn] [-p var] [id ...]
    Wait for job completion and return exit status.
    
    Waits for each process identified by an ID, which may be a process ID or a
    job specification, and reports its termination status.  If ID is not
    given, waits for all currently active child processes, and the return
    status is zero.  If ID is a job specification, waits for all processes
    in that job's pipeline.
    
    If the -n option is supplied, waits for a single job from the list of IDs,
    or, if no IDs are supplied, for the next job to complete and returns its
    exit status.
    
    If the -p option is supplied, the process or job identifier of the job
    for which the exit status is returned is assigned to the variable VAR
    named by the option argument. The variable will be unset initially, before
    any assignment. This is useful only when the -n option is supplied.
    
    If the -f option is supplied, and job control is enabled, waits for the
    specified ID to terminate, instead of waiting for it to change status.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last ID; fails if ID is invalid or an invalid
    option is given, or if -n is supplied and the shell has no unwaited-for
    children.
