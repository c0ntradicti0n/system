As motion is a kind combination of space and time.\\nAnother good hint to the structure, that MUST be observed, is: 1 - is the general, 2 - is the particular, 3 - is the individual as their combination.\\n\"", "prompt": "'You are extending a dialectical system, emulating Hegel\\'s methodology, where concepts unfold within a \\nfractal structure of triples. Each triple consists of:\\n\\n - Thesis (1)\\n - Antithesis (2)\\n - Synthesis (3)\\n\\nEach triple is a dialectical unit, which can be further extended by adding a new triple to any of them.\\n\\nAdditionally we explain about each triple a antinomic mutual relation. Remember the Kantian antinomies, and \\nother famous intricacies. \\nThis should point to  the evolution of the argumentation by identifying the conflict within the \\ndialectic triple, thereby triggering the formation of the next triple. This self-applicable antonym to the thesis \\nexpresses ideas like \\'minus * minus = plus\\', or \\'the disappearance of disappearance is existence.\\') (_)\\n\\nThere is also this constraint: \\nThe fractal lives from semantic analogies, every subtopic from [1-3]*1 should mirror the topics in [1-3]*2 by \\nANALOGY (as far as possible). Please respect this, therefore you are given example other entries, that might correspond.\\n\\nRespect, that it moves from the most abstract to the most concrete concepts when moving deeper into the nesting \\nand horizontally it moves by the defining other concepts by first treating the ingredients and then the complexities \\nof those. Another Note on categorization: The fractal has to conquer the realm of overlapping categories. Feelings might be\\n \"happy\" and \"sad\" as bigger categories and \"joyful\" and \"depressed\" might appear as sub-categories or \\n rather side-categories, this is out preferred approach.\\n This means instead of \\n \\n11 happy\\n111 joyful\\n12 sad\\n121 depressed\\n\\nwe would like to organize it like this:\\n\\n111 happy\\n112 sad\\n121 joyful\\n122 depressed\\n\\nSo the most basic category opens the field and gets mirrored by the other categories and dividing up all opposites \\ninside a nesting.\\n\\nAlso respect, that we handle the concepts as \"ideals\" and daily politics and doubts are not the topic here, if something\\nneeds to be changed, it should be changed, there must not be a hint, that something might not be right.\\n\\nYou\\'ll work with a representation reflecting your current progress. Each unit is addressed via a key as \"13221.\" \\nfor the thesis in \"1322\".\\nYour goal is enrich the thematic structure of the fractal triples by diving deeper by creating \\nnew triples.\\n\\nEvery nesting level should have a bare path for telling the theme and also a \\'_\\'-entry to mark dialectical conceptual \\nmovement, every path should match this regex: [1-3]_?\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- suggest alternative topic\\n122133. new topic\\n\\n- suggest alternative inversion antonym\\n23132_ new inversion antonym\\n\\n- suggest alternative thesis\\n3321 new thesis\\n\\n- suggest alternative antithesis\\n13322 new antithesis\\n\\n- suggest alternative synthesis\\n23 new synthesis\\n\\n- add multiple things like (but with other contents). PREFER THIS FOR MANY ENTRIES\\n31 {1: \"Force\", 2: \"Motion\", 3: \"Energy\", \"_\": \"Inertia-Dynamics\", \".\": \"Physics\"}\\n32 {1: \"Cell\", 2: \"Organism\", 3: \"Ecosystem\", \"_\": \"Individual-Community\", \".\": \"Biology\"}\\n31 {1: \"Atom\", 2: \"Molecule\", 3: \"Compound\", \"_\": \"Element-Compound\", \".\": \"Chemistry\"}\\n\\n- shift the position of a thing:\\n312 <-> 213\\n\\nStick exactly to this syntax, don\\'t exchange: \\'.\\', \\'_\\' with more meaningful information, put the meaning only into \\nthe strings.\\nRespond only with the keys like 31332 and succinct suggestions. Avoid any other explanatory phrase! Your proposals should \\nbe limited to 1-4 word titles, no sentences.\\nThus your output should be a list with a syntax like this:\\n\\n122133 \"Colors\"\\n23132 \"Wave-Particle\"\\n332 \"Light\"\\n1332 \"Darkness\"\\n2 \"Color\"\\n31 {1: \"Force\", 2: \"Motion\", 3: \"Energy\", \"_\": \"Inertia-Dynamics\", \".\": \"Physics\"}\\n23313 <-> 32232\\n\\nDon\\'t be audacious and dont just change the series of words in one title, keep it as simple as possible, avoid \\nrepetitions in titles, the simplest words are the best and less words is more content. Be enormously precise \\nwith your answers and the keys, every wrong path causes chaos and will kill the whole project.\\nFocus only on scientific objective topics as math, geometry, physics, chemistry, biology, epistemology, music, \\ncolors, linguistics and other real things with popular polarities. Absolutely avoid any topics of philosophy \\nof mind and psychology and avoid the topic of consciousness at all. Philosophers nowadays are not able to think \\nabout consciousness, the language is partying there too much.\\nFocus on a top-down approach to get to some more systematic dialectical structure; first all upper levels, then the lower levels.\\nFocus on completeness of the fractal, please fill up all incomplete triples, rather add new triples than improving existing ones.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlase provide something that causes the conflict in\\n321_, Theory-Practice,\\n\\nAnd please dump all your knowledge accurately about 321, Education, and 3211, Learning Process, and 3212, Teaching Methods, and 3213, Learning Styles,'", "task": "'toc'"}, "time": 1703255256.3307006}
