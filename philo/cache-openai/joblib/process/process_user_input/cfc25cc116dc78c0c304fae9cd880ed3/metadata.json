Constrain yourself writing text to the mentioned headings! And don't forget the quote.\\n\"", "prompt": "'You are providing the tex for ONE level of a a dialectical system, emulating Hegel\\'s methodology, where concepts unfold within a fractal structure of triples. Each triple consists of:\\n\\n - Thesis (1)\\n - Antithesis (2)\\n - Synthesis (3)\\n\\nEach triple is a dialectical unit, which can be further extended by adding new triples to any of them.\\n\\nAdditionally we mention the antinomic mutual relation about each triple. This is a pivot concept that amplifies the evolution of the argumentation by identifying the conflict within the synthesis, that is semantically contructed from a relation of thesis and antithesis, as the \"vanishing of the vanishing itself\" in the example below. But don\\'t repeat that or use it as a reference.\\n\\nYou\\'ll provided a table of contents and a key, as well es text before and after, if there is, and you\\'ll create text content for it for one chapter.\\n\\nEach chapter is addressed via a key as \"13221\", meaning the \"thesis\" in \"1322\".\\nAnd will answer with a list of keys and suggestions for the content of the chapters. Use exactly the following syntax:\\n\\n```\\n# 1321 \\nyour text for the thesis\\n\\n# 1322 \\nyour text for the antithesis\\n\\n# 1323 \\nyour text for the synthesis\\n\\n# 132_ \\nyour text for the antinomic mutual relation of this dialectical unit\\n```\\n\\nThis is the basic level of the whole system.\\nAvoid any other explanatory phrase. Your texts can have markdown-syntax or mermaid-graphs for anything, but this should not be needed much.\\nKeep mind to explain to the point their dialectical relationship, what the concept means under the hood and how it relates to the other near concepts in the toc.\\n\\n\\nA very neat example is the first chapter, take this as a inspiration for your work:\\n\\n```\\n# 1111 Pure Being\\nBeing is absolute indeterminateness and emptiness, without any content to be distinguished within or from anything else, existing only in the purity of its self-equality. However, this pure being, in its indeterminate immediacy, equates to nothing, for it contains no distinguishing content, rendering it equal to pure nothingness in its undifferentiated absence of determination.\\n\\n# 1112 Pure Nothing\\nNothing, though it signifies absence, has a semantic existence in our cognition as the counterpart to being, hence nothing and being, while appearing antithetical, are in essence the same. Nonetheless, they are distinct in their immediacy, with each state immediately vanishing into its opposite, giving rise to the concept of becoming, a constant fluid transition between being and nothing.\\n\\n# 1113 Becoming\\nBecoming, the unseparated unity of being and nothing, encapsulates these states as vanishing moments, constantly in flux, expressing itself through two key movements: coming-to-be, where nothing transitions to being, and ceasing-to-be, where being transitions to nothing. This continuous interplay leads to a self-sublation within each state, causing the \"vanishing of the vanishing itself\", settling into a stable unity that encapsulates the vanished becoming, which is determinate being, a unity of being and nothing in the form of being.\\n\\n# 111_ \\nVanishing of the vanishing itself\\n```\\n\\nPlease provide a famous quote in any chapter about the topic.\\n\\nDon\\'t write for subtopics, only for the main topics. The subtopics will be filled automatically by the system. So it \\nshould contain four chapters and maximum 4 headings overall.\\n\\nProvide the text for ONE level of the text for the following paths and topics headed with:\\n\\n1 Objectivity\\n11 Things and Properties\\n12 Framework of Placement\\n13 Nature\\n1_ Synthetic a Priori\\n2 Subjectivity\\n21 Natrual Necessity\\n22 Values\\n23 Making\\n2_ Objective-Subjective\\n3 Culture\\n_ System-Chaos'", "task": "'text'"}, "time": 1703543284.4101083}
